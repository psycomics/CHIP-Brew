# CHIP-Brew
Interface for CHIP external cooling loop 
More code will be added soon...

The aim will be to have an web based interface (PHP) which interacts with the python code to run the system, similar to brewPi (https://github.com/BrewPi).  However, it will be based upon a cooling circuit instead of a fridge so will require a completely different control scheme.
